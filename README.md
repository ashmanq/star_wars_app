# Star Wars JavaScript App

### The purpose of creating this app was to demonstrate the following:
* The ability to setup a simple Vue app
* Reading data from an online API
* Make requests using Promise.all
* Implement filters in Vue.js

### The App carrys out the following:
* Displays a list of the first 6 Star Wars movies
* Clicking on a movie will give you details of the movie including the title, episode number, release date, director, characters and character homeworlds
* Character heights are filtered from centimeters to meters using Vues filters
* Film release dates are converted from MM DD YYY to DD MM YYY format using a Vue filter
* Vue routing is used so that when the user clicks on the 'Movie Opening' link, they are taken to a new page showing the movie intro scrawl
